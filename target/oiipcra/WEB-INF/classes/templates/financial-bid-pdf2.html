        <p>The comparative statement for the bids downloaded from e-procurement system is attached as
            <strong>Attachment-2.</strong></p>
        <p>3.2 &nbsp; Responsiveness to Commercial Conditions:</p>
        <p>None of the bidders have stipulated any deviations from the commercial conditions of the
            bidding documents, and all the bids are therefore; considered responsive to the commercial
            conditions.</p>
        <p>3.3 &nbsp; Responsiveness to Technical Requirements.</p>
           <p> The technical responsiveness of bid has been examined by the Review Committee for Procurement with respect to the bid conditions which were not covered during
               evaluation of Part 1 bids, i.e., in respect of Priced Bill of Quantities, and Technical Specifications, in accordance with ITB Clause-3.
               The bids are compliant with the Technical Specifications/ Requirements and considered technically responsive. Bid of the bidders at Paragraph-3
               above are determined to be substantially responsive to the commercial and technical provisions of the bidding documents.</p>
        <p><strong>4.0 &nbsp; Detailed Evaluation of the Substantially Responsive Bids</strong></p>
        <p>4.1</p>
        <p>The single responsive bid that of <strong>M/s BKD Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., Super-Class Contractor.</strong>
            found to be -1.56% Less than the technical sanctioned estimate cost put to tender.</p>
        <p>4.2</p>
        <p>There are no such conditions but the quoted prices for some of the major items of work warranted the loading of the bid price. No other specific evaluation criterion
            has been stipulated in the bid document. As such, the loading of the prices is therefore calculated at <strong><img src="../pdf-resources/images/rupee.png" width="8px"/> 956,799.00.</strong></p>
        <p>4.3</p>
        <p>The bid is evaluated and otherwise found to be substantially responsive. The Evaluation Committee discussed and concluded reasonableness of the bidderâ€™s price and
            recommended for <strong>acceptance.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>5.0 &nbsp; Comments on the Unbalanced Bid Items</strong></p>
        <p>There are several items having quoted rates to be considered as unbalanced in the lowest
            evaluated responsive bid and the value of the items considered as unbalanced/ loading of bid
            prices computed to <strong><img src="../pdf-resources/images/rupee.png" width="8px"/> 956,799.00.</strong> However, no subcontracting has been proposed.</p>
        <p><strong>6.0 &nbsp; Computation of Bid Capacity of the lowest responsive bidder</strong></p>
        <p>6.1 <br/>The bid capacity of bidder is computed following the limitations provided in ITB Clause -3 (b) for
            amount of Annual Financial Turnover and Clause-3 (g) for Availability of liquid assets and/or
            credit facilities. Further, according to clause-3, when a bidder participates in multiple bids, the
            bidder has to demonstrate the qualifications for Annual Turnover (3(b)) and Availability of liquid
            assets (3(g)) to the cumulative value of the packages. Further, the balance bid capacity after
            award of work is computed as under:<br/>
            <strong>Maximum Bid Capacity = 1 x Max Annual Turnover x Period for Completion in Years.
            Balance Bid Capacity = Max Bid Capacity - 2 x Estd. Cost of Work</strong></p>
        <p>6.2</p>
        <p>The bidder has participated and evaluated as Lowest Responsive bidder in <strong>2 Nos.</strong> of the
            packages in the Package IDs: <strong>BGH-05, BGR-07.</strong><br/>
